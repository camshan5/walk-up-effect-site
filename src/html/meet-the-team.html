                Brandon was born and raised in Southern California, where he
                quickly developed a love of sports and water. At a young age,
                Brandon jumped into the sport of water polo and quickly fell in
                love with the game.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-4 text-muted mb-6">
                Fast forward several years, Brandon is playing college water
                polo at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, CA.
                During his time in college, Brandon decided to give coaching a
                shot which led to a new passion... teaching!

              <p class="fs-lg text-muted mb-6">
                Upon graduation, he jumped into the education world and became a
                7th-grade algebra teacher and athletic director. After a few
                years of teaching, Brandon took a job as a director at Apex
                Leadership Co. Apex is a company that contracts with schools
                throughout the United States to teach a unique program focused
                on valuable leadership skills for students. Additionally, Apex

                Brandon has a love for helping others be their best selves and
                reach their full potential. While on his honeymoon, Brandon
                received the heartbreaking news of a mass shooting at a bar in
                the town he attended college. This news led Brandon to develop
                the idea of

                Trevor was born in Seattle, Washington but grew up most of his
                life in a small, central California farm town. Growing up, he
                not only had a strong passion for playing sports but also music,
                which led him to learn how to play the drums. Although he played
                basketball and did Track & Field, football is where he truly
                shined and became most passionate eventually leading him to play
                at the college level at California Lutheran University in
                Thousand Oaks, CA.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-4 text-muted mb-6">
                During his time in college, he got linked up with an incredible
                organization called Apex Leadership Company, in which he now
                co-owns and operates, serving elementary and middle school all
                over the greater Los Angeles and Orange County area.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-lg text-muted mb-6">
                Apex Leadership Co. brings young, energetic individuals (many
                ex-college athletes) who are passionate about empowering youth
                onto school campuses and teaches students impactful leadership
                lessons, helps them develop positive character attributes, and
                raises the school much-needed funds.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-lg text-muted mb-6">
                Trevor is the oldest of 5 siblings whose mother has been taking
                in foster children through the foster care system for the last
                15 years. To say he has had a strong heart for young people is
                an understatement as he has been involved in children's lives
                who have been in the most unimaginable and tragic of
                circumstances.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-lg text-muted mb-6">
                For Trevor, that fire for young people burns stronger now than
                ever knowing there are so many young people struggling with
                mental health, including family members. Like Brandon, Trevor
                too was devastated and touched in a major way after receiving
                the news of the locally-known Thousand Oaks establishment,
                Borderline Bar and Grill, being the site of a mass shooting.
                Having friends that were present during this tragedy and losing
                a couple of classmates was something they never thought they'd
                experience.

                Trevor hopes to bring awareness to mental health in young
                people, educate them on how they can help their peers and,
                provide those struggling with the resources to overcome, and in
                turn, live a fulfilled life.
