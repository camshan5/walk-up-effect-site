                Brandon was born and raised in Southern California, where he
                quickly developed a love of sports and water. At a young age,
                Brandon jumped into the sport of water polo and quickly fell in
                love with the game.
              </p>

              <p class="fs-4 text-muted mb-6">
                Fast forward several years, Brandon is playing college water
                polo at California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, CA.
                During his time in college, Brandon decided to give coaching a
                shot which led to a new passion... teaching!
              </p>

              <p class="fs-lg text-muted mb-6">
                Upon graduation, he jumped into the education world and became a
                7th-grade algebra teacher and athletic director. After a few
                years of teaching, Brandon took a job as a director at Apex
                Leadership Co. Apex is a company that contracts with schools
                throughout the United States to teach a unique program focused
                on valuable leadership skills for students. Additionally, Apex
                Leadership offers a service that utilizes its staff and the
                students who have taken the leadership course, to assist the
                school in raising contributions from the families and community
                for the school.
              </p>
              <p class="fs-lg text-muted mb-6">
                Brandon has a love for helping others be their best selves and
                reach their full potential. While on his honeymoon, Brandon
                received the heartbreaking news of a mass shooting at a bar in
                the town he attended college. This news led Brandon to develop
                the idea of
                <span class="zap-02 text-nowrap">The Walk Up Effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="fs-lg text-muted">
                Brandon brings the vision behind the company that will help
                provide the youth with the resources and strength they need to
                overcome mental health struggles.
