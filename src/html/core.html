              “Walk Up”…what does that actually mean. In a sense, you can take
              it quite literally and define it as walking up to someone or
              something. And while that may be true, our one word answer to
              “what does walk up mean”, is COURAGE. Walking up means that
              someone has the courage to do 1 of 2 things.
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Having the courage to walk up to someone who may be struggling
              with something. Walking up to them and taking the 6 walk up steps
              to ensure that they have a sense of hope and strength to continue
              moving forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Having the courage to walk up to someone and being vulnerable
              enough to express that you are struggling with mental health.
              Letting someone know that you have anxiety, depression, or
              suicidal thoughts. Its having the courage to step out of your
              comfort zone and the strength to express your struggles openly.
              Its having the courage to SHARE YOUR STORY!
